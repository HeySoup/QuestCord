# QuestCord
Discord integration for the oculus quest and quest 2.
In this release you have the standard working parts of discord
Text chat, voice chat etc.
I plan to bring screenshare into questcord although it will take time,
Oculus screenshot share has been put into this version of quest cord,
Not all photos may show up, working on a fix, 
Inject the file with sidequest or any typical sideloader.
!!this app does not flag your account for any form of piracy, therefor dev mode wont get disabled!!


THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE 
AND THEREFOR THERE ARE BUGS
HERE IS THE LIST OF BUGS I HAVE COME ACROSS
AND PLAN TO FIX

Discord call audio not coming through well,
Push to talk issues,
Image and server invite loading issues,
Lag in bigger servers or if there is chat spam,

Other than that enjoy this version of questcord.
If you want to wait for the release of version 1.0 which is the final "hotfix"
Than you shall do so
Version 0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9, are all pre-release and are hotfixes 
While version 1.0 is the "final" version which shall only be updated if needed.
Version 1.0 will arrive on sidequest shortly after arriving on the GitHub.

After questcord 1.0 I intend to work on a 
Twitter integration
Spotify integration
Vpn integration (for surfing the oculus browser)
And more.
All coming after v 1.0 of eachother. Release dates tbd
And it's really depending whether I feel like working on it or not.
